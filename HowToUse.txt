How to use:
	The project consists of 2 pages. One that can create a new account for a specified customer, and one you can view account details for a specified customer or add transactions for specified account.
	The routing can be done easily from page to page since each page has a button that navigates to the other page.
	When adding a transaction:
		If you entered an account id that doesn't exist, an error will occur.
		If you entered 0 in the amount, an error will occur.
		If you entered a negative number, it will be detucted from the balance, unless the number is bigger than the balance, then an error will occur.
		If you entered a positive number, the transaction will be made.

	When fetching account details:
		If you entered a customer id that doesn't exist, an error will occur.

	When adding a new account for a customer:
		If you entered a customer id that doesn't exist, an error will occur.
		If you entered a negative initial credit, an error will occur.
		If you entered 0 as an initial credit, an account will be created for the specified use but without any transactions.
		If you entered a positive number greater than 0, an account will be created for the specified user, with a new transaction for the new account.
